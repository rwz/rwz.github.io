Welcome to my super awesome new blog where I rant about things. I don't know if I will ever actually write anything but here we go.

Also, I need a place to test my new commenting system anyways, so feel free to comment a lot. Or just ignore it, I'll comment my
own posts just fine.

Another thing worth mentioning: I'm Russian. That mostly mean that my English suck and you should complain loudly in comments
every time I make a mistake or typo or whatever.

Here's a cool picture of Tony Stark of Winterfell: ![Tony Stark of Winterfell](/public/images/2014-04-10-tony-stark.jpg "Tony Stark of Winterfell")
